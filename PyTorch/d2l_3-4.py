#3-4 Softmax regression
#one-hot encoding is a vector wit as many components as we have categories. If we have 3 categories
# A, B, C showing in one-hot encoding could be like A=(1,0,0); B=(0,1,0); C=(0,0,1)

Summary:
    -The softmax operation takes a vector and maps it into probabilities.
    -Softmax regression applies to classification problems. It uses the probability distribution
of the output class in the softmax operation.
    -Cross-entropy is a good measure of the difference between two probability distributions. It
measures the number of bits needed to encode the data given our model.
