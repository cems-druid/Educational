Hello, this is my educational repository, which you can find my:
-Sample of a code according to the context
-unfinished or very hardly finished projects
-Some of tutorials replicas.

Most of the codes in this folder is not 100% my codes.
The projects in here is also not a copy-paste codes, I practice the topic and I put here so I can show what I practiced. 
It is basically some kind of portfolio, and a very complex diary which shows my frustrations, happiness and stockholm syndrome to the software development.
